GOTEST
========
**gotest is a simple test assertion package**\

\
gotest provides clear readouts of tests performed set by the Configurations:
  *  [`PrintTest`](# "Config Field") prints the expected and actual output of every test
  *  [`PrintFail`](# "Config Field") prints the expected and actual output when a test fails
  *  [`PrintTrace`](# "Config Field") prints the location of the test in the test file
  *  [`Truncate`](# "Config Field") limits the data printed to console

Getting Started:
  * Install gtest with [go get](#installation)
  * Use our example to see how to run your first gotest
  
\
Installation
------------
To install gotest, use `go get`:

    go get github.com/jcdotter/go/test

or include the `github.com/jcdotter/go/test` package as an import in your test file and run:

    go mod tidy

Use this template in your code to get started with your first basic test:

```go
package your_package

import (
    "testing"
    gt "github.com/jcdotter/go/test"
)

func TestYourCode(t *testing.T) {

    gt.True(t, true, "True is true!")

}
```


Configuration
-------------
Configure the settings for the tester using the test.Config struct

**Step 1**. Create a new `test_file.go`
```go
package your_package

import (
    "testing"
    "github.com/jcdotter/go/test"
)

func TestYourCode(t *testing.T) {

    config := &test.Config{
        PrintTest: true,
        PrintTrace: true,
        PrintDetail: true,
        Msg: "result: %s",
    }

    gt := test.New(t, config)

    gt.True(true, "true is true!")

}
```

**Step 2**. Run the test in your terminal
```
$ go test -run TestYourCode
```
**Step 3**. Check your terminal output
```
#0 test 'True' succeeded: result: true is true!
  src:          test_file.TestYourCode line 18
  expected:     true
  actual:       true
```
